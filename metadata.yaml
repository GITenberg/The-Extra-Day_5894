description: Blackwood was born in Shooter's Hill (today part of south-east London,
  but then part of northwest Kent) and educated at Wellington College. His father
  was a Post Office administrator who, according to Peter Penzoldt, ""though not devoid
  of genuine good-heartedness, had appallingly narrow religious ideas"".Blackwood
  had a varied career, farming in Canada, operating a hotel, as a newspaper reporter
  in New York City, and, throughout his adult life, an occasional essayist for various
  periodicals. In his late thirties, he moved back to England and started to write
  stories of the superna.
